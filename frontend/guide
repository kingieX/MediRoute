# ðŸ—‚ Master To-Do Checklist â€“ MediRoute (Smart Hospital Staff & Patient Flow Optimization)

### Phase 0 â€“ Project Setup & Infrastructure

- [ ] Create GitHub repository (monorepo with `frontend/` + `backend/`)
- [ ] Setup branch protection, PR review rules, issue templates
- [ ] Initialize Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis, backend, frontend services)
- [ ] Configure `.env` files (local, staging, production)
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions: lint, test, build, deploy)
- [ ] Provision cloud deployments (Vercel for frontend, Render for backend)
- [ ] Setup monitoring tools (Prometheus/Grafana for backend, Vercel Analytics for frontend)

---

### Phase 1 â€“ Backend Core Architecture (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis)

**Authentication & Access Control**

- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`)
- [ ] Add role-based access (Admin, Doctor, Nurse) middleware
- [ ] Secure endpoints with RBAC

**User & Staff Management**

- [ ] CRUD endpoints for users (`/users/`, `/users/{id}`)
- [ ] Hash & store passwords securely
- [ ] Seed initial admin user

**Scheduling Engine**

- [ ] DB schema: `users`, `shifts`, `departments`
- [ ] Endpoint: `/shifts/` CRUD
- [ ] Endpoint: `/shifts/auto-assign` (Google OR-Tools)
- [ ] Endpoint: `/shifts/manual-assign` (drag-drop support)
- [ ] Unit tests for assignment logic

**Patient Flow**

- [ ] Endpoint: `/patients/admit` (create patient)
- [ ] Endpoint: `/patients/{id}/move` (update dept)
- [ ] Endpoint: `/patients/` (filter by status/dept)
- [ ] Endpoint: `/patients/history`
- [ ] Track congestion per department

**Departments & Resources**

- [ ] Endpoint: `/departments/` CRUD
- [ ] Endpoint: `/departments/{id}/status` (staff/patient load)

**Real-Time Updates**

- [ ] Setup Redis Pub/Sub channels (`staff_update`, `patient_update`, `alert_trigger`)
- [ ] WebSocket integration (Socket.IO for staff & patient updates)
- [ ] Broadcast DB changes over WebSockets

**Alerts & Notifications**

- [ ] Endpoint: `/alerts/` fetch active alerts
- [ ] Endpoint: `/alerts/config` set thresholds
- [ ] WebSocket push for alerts
- [ ] Optional integration: Twilio/SendGrid for SMS/email
- [ ] Unit tests for alert triggers

**Analytics & Reporting**

- [ ] Endpoints:

  - `/analytics/staffing-trends`
  - `/analytics/congestion-trends`
  - `/analytics/exports/pdf`
  - `/analytics/exports/csv`

- [ ] Implement PDF/CSV generation via Celery task queue
- [ ] Store event logs in TimescaleDB for historical analysis

**System & Monitoring**

- [ ] `/health` endpoint (readiness probe)
- [ ] `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus)

---

### Phase 2 â€“ Frontend Core (Next.js + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui + WebSockets)

**Authentication & Access**

- [ ] Build login page (email/password, error handling)
- [ ] Implement forgot/reset password flow
- [ ] Secure JWT storage (HTTP-only cookie)
- [ ] Role-based dashboards (Admin vs Doctor/Nurse)

**Dashboard (Role-Based)**

- [ ] Sidebar + Navbar navigation (role-aware)
- [ ] Admin dashboard with quick stats (staff on duty, patient load)
- [ ] Doctor/Nurse dashboard (personal shifts, notifications)

**Staff Scheduler**

- [ ] Weekly/monthly calendar view
- [ ] Drag-drop UI for manual staff assignment
- [ ] Shift template management modal
- [ ] Auto-assign button (calls backend optimizer)
- [ ] Test optimistic UI updates with backend sync

**Patient Flow Manager**

- [ ] Queue view of patients per department
- [ ] Load indicators (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Reroute patient controls
- [ ] WebSocket updates to reflect real-time wait times

**Real-Time Hospital Map**

- [ ] Leaflet.js hospital map (rooms/wings layout)
- [ ] Staff/patient icons with tooltips
- [ ] Live WebSocket updates on map markers

**Alerts & Notifications**

- [ ] UI for active alerts (banners/toasts)
- [ ] Config modal for thresholds & notification rules
- [ ] Notification history page

**Analytics & Reporting**

- [ ] Charts (Chart.js/ECharts for staffing trends, congestion)
- [ ] Filters (date range, department)
- [ ] Export buttons (CSV/PDF download)

**Settings & Management**

- [ ] User management (role-based CRUD)
- [ ] Department setup UI
- [ ] Access logs screen

---

### Phase 3 â€“ Integration & Event-Driven Processes

- [ ] Establish WebSocket connection post-login
- [ ] Sync real-time staff/patient updates across dashboard, scheduler, and map
- [ ] Trigger alerts â†’ display on frontend + optional SMS/email
- [ ] Ensure optimistic UI â†’ sync corrections with backend
- [ ] Build offline mode (cached data + warning banner)

---

### Phase 4 â€“ Testing & QA

**Backend**

- [ ] Unit tests (scheduling, alerts, patient routing)
- [ ] Integration tests (API + WebSocket events)
- [ ] Load testing with 500+ simulated events

**Frontend**

- [ ] Component-level tests (React Testing Library)
- [ ] E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright) for login, scheduling, patient flow
- [ ] WebSocket responsiveness test (simulate event flood)

**System**

- [ ] Security tests (RBAC, JWT expiration, SQL injection prevention)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring (target 99.9%)

---

### Phase 5 â€“ Deployment & Documentation

- [ ] Finalize CI/CD for staging + production
- [ ] Deploy backend on Render (Dockerized)
- [ ] Deploy frontend on Vercel
- [ ] Configure domains + HTTPS certs
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboards (Grafana/Prometheus)

**Documentation**

- [ ] Generate OpenAPI spec (FastAPI auto-docs)
- [ ] Storybook for UI components
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide (README + setup scripts)
- [ ] User/Admin manual with screenshots
- [ ] Post-MVP roadmap (Mobile app, IoT integration, predictive analytics)

âœ… Thatâ€™s the **single exhaustive checklist** combining:

- Requirements doc (phases/features)
- Backend plan
- Frontend plan
